Dr. Keane divides the world’s people into four classes, the ‘Negro or black, in the Sudan, South Africa, and Oceania (Australasia); Mongol or yellow, in Central, North, and East Asia; Amerinds (red or brown), in the New World; and Caucasians (white and also dark), in North Africa, Europe, Irania, India, Western Asia, and Polynesia.‘ Discussing the various nationalities and subdivisions of these four general divisions, *736 he unhesitatingly places the Syrians in the Caucasian or white division. The Assistant United States Attorney, representing the government, objecting to the naturalization of Najour, seems to attach some importance to the fact that the applicant was born within the dominions of Turkey, and was heretofore a subject of the Sultan of Turkey. I do not think this should cut any figure in the matter. If it did, the extension of the Turkish Empire over people unquestionably of the white race would deprive them of the privilege of naturalization. In my opinion the applicant belongs to the white race within the meaning of the statute, and the other requisites existing after careful examination, he is clearly entitled to naturalization.\n"

He is not particularly dark, and has none of the characteristics or appearance of the Mongolian race, but, so far as I can see and judge, has the appearance and characteristics of the Caucasian race. Quite a recent work, which I have before me now, ‘The World’s People,‘ by Dr. A. H. Keane, classifies, without question or qualification in any way, Syrians as a part of the Caucasian or white race, and this they are, so far as my knowledge and information goes. Dr. Keane divides the world’s people into four classes, the ‘Negro or black, in the Sudan, South Africa, and Oceania (Australasia); Mongol or yellow, in Central, North, and East Asia; Amerinds (red or brown), in the New World; and Caucasians (white and also dark), in North Africa, Europe, Irania, India, Western Asia, and Polynesia.‘ Discussing the various nationalities and subdivisions of these four general divisions, *736 he unhesitatingly places the Syrians in the Caucasian or white division. The Assistant United States Attorney, representing the government, objecting to the naturalization of Najour, seems to attach some importance to the fact that the applicant was born within the dominions of Turkey, and was heretofore a subject of the Sultan of Turkey. I do not think this should cut any figure in the matter. If it did, the extension of the Turkish Empire over people unquestionably of the white race would deprive them of the privilege of naturalization. In my opinion the applicant belongs to the white race within the meaning of the statute, and the other requisites existing after careful examination, he is clearly entitled to naturalization.The petitioner was born in Damascus, and testified that he was a Syrian by race. The United States attorney was asked if he opposed the petitioner’s naturalization. He replied that the United States would call the court’s attention to the petitioner’s birthplace and presumed race; that it would neither approve nor oppose naturalization, but would leave the allowance thereof to the judgment of the court. This course the court deems quite improper, for reasons which may here be stated briefly. Section 11 of the present naturalization act provides that the United States— ‘shall have the right to appear before any court or courts exercising jurisdiction in naturalization proceedings for the purpose of cross-examining the petitioner and the witnesses produced in support of his petition concerning any matter touching or in any way affecting his right to admission to citizenship, and shall have the right to call witnesses, produce evidence and be heard in opposition to the granting of any petition in naturalization proceedings.‘ Act June 29, 1906, c. 3592, 34 Stat. 599 (U.S. Comp. St. Supp. 1909, p. 482). *466 The court is informed and understands that, by virtue of the section just quoted and of instructions thereupon issued by the Bureau of Naturalization, the United States attorney has made careful inquiry concerning the admissibility of the petitioner in the case at bar, and in like cases. The court is glad to acknowledge the helpfulness of this preliminary inquiry. Without it the examination of the petitioner and of his witnesses in court, whether conducted by the attorney or by the court itself, would be at haphazard, as was the examination by the court before the act of 1906. By the course now adopted, the proof in every case is made satisfactory; while, under the old statute, real proof was very often wanting. But the act of 1906 has done more than help the judge in making an investigation of fact for himself. We need not consider what would be the court’s duty if the United States should now take no part in naturalization proceedings. Such a course is practically unthinkable. Where preliminary inquiry has been made; where the attorney attends at the hearing, and in behalf of the United States examines the petitioner and his witnesses with the freedom permitted in cross-examination; where the right to offer additional evidence is fully recognized, being often exercised in like case— the court is ordinarily justified in restricting its function to a decision as between litigants. The court, indeed, is not required to admit the petitioner to citizenship, although the United States assents thereto; but, after a hearing conducted as above described, the court will ordinarily admit to citizenship in the absence of declared opposition by the United States. No more than any other litigant can the United States be permitted to put the court to an independent investigation of law or of fact, without announcing its own contention in the matter. That which the United States is unwilling to support by argument the court need not consider seriously. When this position had been explained to the United States attorney, he promptly and properly announced that the United States opposed the naturalization of the petitioner on the ground that he was not a free white person within the meaning of Rev. St. Sec. 2169 (U.S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1333). In support of their several contentions, the United States and the petitioner have submitted briefs. The case at bar is pretty well covered by the opinion of this court in the Halladjian Case, 174 Fed. 834, although what was there said of Armenians does not apply in every respect to Syrians. Those who call themselves Syrians by race are probably of a blood more mixed than those who describe themselves as Armenians. However this may be, the older writers on ethnology are substantially agreed that Syrians are to be classed as of the Caucasian or white race. Modern writers on ethnology, who have departed from the ancient classification, are not agreed in substituting any other which can be applied under section 2169. Inasmuch as Syrians have been classified as above stated, and as this court has long admitted Syrians to citizenship, the petitioner will also be admitted. While the case at bar is thus free from considerable doubt, yet the court may properly point out that cases of difficulty are likely to arise in construing section 2169, unless its wording is changed and the intent of Congress is made to appear. That section implies a classification *467 of some sort. What may be called for want of a better name the Caucasian-Mongolian classification is not now held to be valid by any considerable body of ethnologists. To make naturalization depend upon this classification is to make an important result depend upon the application of an abandoned scientific theory, a course of proceeding which surely brings the law and its administration into disrepute. Here it is impossible to substitute a modern and accepted theory for one which has been abandoned. No modern theory has gained general acceptance. Hardly any one classifies any human race as white, and none can be applied under section 2169 without making distinctions which Congress certainly did not intend to draw; e.g., a distinction between the inhabitants of different parts of France. Thus classification by ethnological race is almost or quite impossible. On the other hand, to give the phrase ‘white person‘ the meaning which it bore when the first naturalization act was passed, viz., any person not otherwise designated or classified, is to make naturalization depend upon the varying and conflicting classification of persons in the usage of successive generations and of different parts of a large country. The court greatly hopes that an amendment of the statutes will make quite clear the meaning of the word ‘white‘ in section 2169.This is an application on the part of Tom Ellis, a Turkish subject, for admission to citizenship in the United States. The applicant is a Syrian, a native of the province of Palestine, and a Maronite. He lived near Beirut, which city was his port of departure in coming to this country. Ethnologically, he is of Semitic stock, a markedly white type of the race. Brinton’s Races and People, pp. 99, 105, 132, 137. See, also, Keane’s World’s People, pp. 307, 310, 335, 337; Deniker’s Races of Man, p. 423. From these references, it is admitted by the United States Attorney that the applicant ‘is a member of what is known as the white or Caucasian race.‘ *1003 ‘Indeed,‘ he continues, ‘no contention is made by the naturalization officers of the United States that Syrians do not belong to the white race. ‘ Otherwise, the applicant is of good morals, sober and industrious, speaks and writes the English language, has a fair understanding of our institutions and form of government, and is well disposed toward the government, and possesses, without question, all the essential qualifications to entitle him to naturalization, besides being a good and highly respected citizen in the community in which he lives. It may be said, further, that he was reared a Catholic, and is still of that faith. The essential contention of the government against the admission of the applicant is that the words ‘free white persons,‘ as used in section 2169 of the Revised Statutes (U.S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1333) were intended to include only those peoples of the white race who, at the time of the formation of the government, lived in Europe and were inured to European governmental institutions, or upon the American continent, and comprehended such only of the white races who, from tradition, teaching, and environment, would be predisposed toward our form of government, and thus readily assimilate with the people of the United States. There is authority for this view. In re Camille (C.C.) 6 Fed. 256; In re Balsara (C.C.) 171 Fed. 294. And yet there is reason for the view, based upon more recent legislation and the debates in Congress pertaining thereto, that the word ‘white‘ was employed to distinguish between the white, the African, and the Mongolian races. In re Saito (C.C.) 62 Fed. 126; In re Ah Yup, 5 Sawy. 155, Fed. Cas. No. 104. While it may be true that a statute should be interpreted in the light of the conditions prevalent under which it was enacted, yet the words ‘free white persons‘ are devoid of ambiguity, and are of plain and simple signification. I know of no technical meaning to be given them in the relation in which they are used in the statute. Applying, therefore, the first and most elementary rule of construction, which is that words and phrases are to be assumed to have been used in their popular sense, if they have not acquired a technical meaning (Endlich, Interpretation of Statutes, Sec. 1), it would seem that the applicant, being a ‘free white person,‘ is entitled to admission as a citizen. As is said by Sawyer, Circuit Judge, in the case of In re Ah Yup, supra, 5 Sawy. 156, Fed. Cas. No. 104: ‘Words in a statute, other than technical terms, should be taken in their ordinary sense. The words ‘white person,’ as well argued by petitioner’s counsel, taken in a strictly literal sense, constitute a very indefinite description of a class of persons, where none can be said to be literally white, and those called white may be found of every shade from the lightest blonde to the most swarthy brunette. But these words, in this country, at least, have undoubtedly acquired a well-settled meaning in common popular speech, and they are constantly used in the sense so acquired in the literature of the country, as well as in common parlance. As ordinarily used everywhere in the United States, one would scarcely fail to understand that the party employing the words ‘white person’ would intend a person of the Caucasian race.‘ What is conceded by the government, that the applicant is a member of what is known as the white or Caucasian race,‘ brings the *1004 case at bar exactly within the authority. If it was designed that the statute was to embrace such of the European races only as in some way by their immigration, alliance, or aid contributed to the settlement of this country and the establishment and upbuilding of the United States as a nation among the peoples of the world, it might have been far better expressed than to have used the simple term ‘white‘ as designating the races of men entitled to naturalization. Not having been so expressed or particularized, the most reasonable inference would be that the word ‘white,‘ ethnologically speaking, was intended to be applied in its popular sense to denote at least the members of the white or Caucasian race of people. If there be ambiguity and doubt, it is better to resolve that doubt in favor of the Caucasian possessed of the highest qualities which go to make an excellent citizen, as the applicant appears to be, and withal drawn to and well disposed toward the principles and policies of this government. The courts can do no more than interpret the law. It is for the Congress to point the policy of the government, and if the word ‘white‘ in its popular sense is of too broad a signification, as applied to persons deemed suitable to become citizens of the United States, the remedy is easily at hand by an amendment of the law. I am of the opinion that the applicant should be admitted to citizenship, and such will be the order of the court.This is an application for naturalization. The applicant has performed all the necessary formalities, and the matter now comes up first upon his right to naturalization, and next whether, conceding that he belongs to the class of persons entitled to the benefit of naturalization, he is a fit subject to be naturalized. According to his statement he is now 59 years of age, and was born at Zahle, in Asia Minor, in Syria, and came to this country about 11 years ago, and is a Christian. He writes his name in Arabic, cannot read or write English, and speaks and understands English very imperfectly, and does not understand any questions relating to the manner and method of government in America, or of the responsibilities of a citizen. His answers to the questions whether he is a polygamist or a disbeliever in organized government were in the affirmative, and he could not be made to understand in English the purport of the *813 questions asked. His wife and most of his children are still living in Syria, and he desires to be naturalized so as to bring them over to this country. In color, he is about that of walnut, or somewhat darker than is the usual mulatto of one-half mixed blood between the white and the negro races. The first question that comes up for consideration is whether a Syrian of Asiatic birth and descent is entitled under the act of Congress to be admitted a citizen of the United States. This depends upon the construction of the provisions of the law, and practically upon the construction of the following clause, which limits the classes entitled to the benefit of the naturalization statute, viz.: ‘The provisions of this title shall apply to aliens being free, white persons, and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.‘ The phrase ‘free white persons‘ was used in the first naturalization statute approved March 26, 1790 (1 Stat. 103, c. 3), and the phrase ‘aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent‘ was incorporated in the amendatory statute approved July 14, 1870 (16 Stat. 254, c. 254). As so phrased, the language of the statute is about as open to many constructions as it possibly could be. Who is a free white person? And who is a person of African nativity or of African descent? It has been decided that the Chinese, Japanese, Malays, and American Indians do not belong to the white race and are therefore excluded. Furthermore, by express additional statutory provision the Chinese are expressly excluded. This, however, leaves open the question: Suppose one of these people had been born in Africa, would the children of Chinese parents, for instance, or Japanese parents, because born in Africa, be of African nativity? Next, what is the meaning of African descent? The Chinaman is not entitled to be admitted to citizenship, but would a half-breed, the child of a negro and a Chinese, be entitled to admission because by his mother’s or his father’s side he was of African descent? Then what is the limitation of African descent? For how many generations would that continue? If the son of an African man by a Chinese woman is entitled to admission by reason of African descent, would the great-great-grandson of an African, although one whose immediate ancestors were Chinese, and who had lived in China, be entitled to admission by reason of the infinitesimal portion of negro blood in him? Then, what is white? What degree of colorization, if it be referred to color, constitutes a white person as against a colored person, and is the court to take the responsibility by ocular inspection of determining the shades of different colorization where the dividing line comes between white and colored. The statute as it stands is most uncertain, ambiguous, and difficult both of construction and application, and all that the court can do is to construe it under the test and control of the legal rules for the construction of statutes. There have been a number of decisions in which the question has been treated, and the conclusions arrived at in them are as unsatisfactory as they are varying, viz.: In re Ah Yup, 5 Sawy. 155, Fed. Cas. No. 104, excluding Mongolians; In re Camille, 6 Fed. 256, excluding a half-breed Indian and white; *814 In re Gee Hop (D.C.) 71 Fed. 274, excluding a Chinese; In re Rodriguez (D.C.) 81 Fed. 337, admitting a Mexican; In re Kumagui (D.C.) 163 Fed. 922, excluding a Japanese; In re Knight (D.C.) 171 Fed. 299, excluding a half-breed Mongolian and white; In re Najour (C.C.) 174 Fed. 735, admitting a Syrian; In re Halladjian (C.C.) 174 Fed. 834, admitting an Armenian; In re Mudarri (C.C.) 176 Fed. 465, admitting a Syrian; Bessho v. U.S., 178 Fed. 245, 101 C.C.A. 605, excluding a Japanese; In re Ellis (D.C.) 179 Fed. 1002, admitting a Maronite; In re Balsara (C.C.) 180 Fed. 294, admitting a Parsee. After considering them all in an attempt to evolve, if possible, some definite rule for judicial decision, the conclusion that this court has arrived at is as follows: That the meaning of free white persons is to be such as would naturally have been given to it when used in the first naturalization act of 1790. Under such interpretation it would mean by the term ‘free white persons‘ all persons belonging to the European races, then commonly counted as white, and their descendants. It would not mean a ‘Caucasian‘ race; a term generally employed only after the date of the statute and in a most loose and indefinite way. The term ‘Caucasian‘ obtained much currency in the pro and anti slavery discussions between 1830 and 1860, but later and more discriminating examination and analysis has shown its entire inapplicability as denoting the families or stocks inhabiting Europe and speaking either the so-called Aryan or Semitic languages. Nor would ‘free white persons‘ mean an ‘Aryan‘ race, a word of much later coinage, and practically unknown to common usage in 1790, and one still more indefinite than Caucasian, and which would exclude all Semitics, viz., Jews and Arabians, and also all Europeans, such as Magyars, Finns, and Basques, not included in the Aryan family. It would not mean ‘Indo-European‘ races, as sometimes ethnologically at the present day defined as including the present mixed Indo-European, Hindu, Malay, and Dravidian inhabitants of East India and Ceylon; nor the mixed Indo-European, Dravidian, Semitic, and Mongolian peoples who inhabit Persia. It would mean such persons as were in 1790 known as white Europeans, with their descendants, including as their descendants their descendants in other countries to which they have emigrated, such as the descendants of the English in Africa or Australia, or of the French and Germans and Russians in other countries. This may not, ethnologically or physiologically speaking, be a very clear and logical construction. It includes all European Jews who are of Semitic descent, more or less intermixed with the peoples of European habitancy, viz., with peoples of Celtic, Scandinavian, Teutonic, Iberian, Latin, Greek, and Slavic descent. It includes Magyars, Lapps, and Finns, who are of Ugric stock, and the Basques and Albanians. It includes the mixed Latin, Celtic-Iberian, and Moorish inhabitants of Spain and Portugal, the mixed Greek, Latin, Phoenician, and North African inhabitants of Sicily, and the mixed Slav and Tartar inhabitants of South Russia. It includes peoples containing many of them blood of very mixed races, but the governing or controlling element or strain in all is supposed to be that of a fair-complexioned people *815 of European descent. In 1790 the distinctions of race were not so well known or carefully drawn as they are to-day. At that date all Europeans were commonly classed as the white race, and the term ‘white‘ person in the statute then enacted must be construed accordingly. To hold that a pure-blooded Chinaman, because born in England or France, was included within the term, would be as far-fetched as to hold that a pure-blooded Englishman, Irishman, or German born in China was excluded. The modern Bengalee or Parsee or Persian may be partly of Indo-european descent. The ancient Zend and Vedic writings apparently emanate from a fair-complexioned, light-haired, if not blue-eyed people. The speakers of Sanscrit, who conquered Hindoostan, or the speakers of ancient Zend, who conquered Persia, were probably within that category. But in India the conqueror seems to have been soon swallowed up in an enormously preponderant brown or black people of different race, and in Persia the same result followed in a degree afterwards accentuated by the terrible Mongolian or Tartar invasions, which destroyed whole communities, replacing them by pure Mongolians. In most Asiatic countries the governing or controlling element or strain is apparently that of a dark-colored people, not of European descent. The Russian settlers in Siberia, and the Greek and Jewish settlements in Asia Minor, and the Armenians on the Asiatic side of the Caucasus, would constitute exceptions. To say that a very dark brown, almost black, inhabitant of India is entitled to rank as a white person, because of a possible or hypothetical infusion of white blood 30 or 40 centuries old, and to exclude a Chinese or Japanese, whose parent on one side was white, and who thus possesses manifestly at least one-half European blood, would seem highly inconsistent. If the matter were placed, as some decisions would indicate, on intellectual status and achievement, then the Japanese and certain of the Chinese would be clearly entitled to stand with many of the so-called white nations and with the Parsee, the Brahmin, and the Persian, and far above the negro races. The law as enacted by Congress gives no place for the consideration of intellectual or moral qualifications or past achievements in a nation or people. It says that the privileges of citizenship of this country may be extended to ‘free white persons‘ and to persons of ‘African nativity‘ and ‘African descent.‘ It may be that a highly educated and cultivated Japanese or Chinese or Malay or Siamese is better calculated to make a useful and desirable citizen than a savage from the Guinea coast, but it is not for the courts to give effect to such reasoning. It may also be that the statute as it stands is ambiguous and defective and most difficult of application. All such questions are for the lawmaking department, and the courts can only apply the law as it finds it on the statute book. In the face of all these difficulties it is safest to follow the reasonable construction of the statute as it would appear to have been intended at the time of its passage, and understand it as restricting the words ‘free white persons‘ to mean persons as then understood to be of European habitancy or descent. By persons of African nativity or *816 African descent presumably the statute means the negro races of Africa or their descendants by intermixture with the races before defined as being the races constituting free white persons. The negro races of Africa presumably referred to are those races from which the emancipated slaves in the United States (who were made citizens by the 14th amendment to the United States Constitution) descend. This construction of the statute would exclude from naturalization all inhabitants of Asia, Australia, the South Seas, the Malaysian Islands and territories, and of South America, who are not of European descent, or of mixed European and African descent. Under this definition the inhabitants of Syria would be excluded. What is the race or color of the modern inhabitant of Syria it is impossible to say. No geographical area of the world has been more mixed since history began. Originally, possibly of Hittite or non-Semitic races, for a time at least under Egyptian domination, then apparently taken possession of largely, and possibly almost exclusively, by the Semitic peoples, then overlaid with immigration from European races, then again followed by another Semitic conquest in the shape of the Arabian Mahometan eruption, then again overlaid by the Mongolian and Turkish conquests, and through it all with an infusion of blood by slaves brought from any accessible part of the world. One Syrian may be of pure or almost pure Jewish, Turkish, or Greek blood, and another the pure-blooded descendant of an Egyptian, an Abyssinian, or a Sudanese. How is the court to decide? It would be most unfortunate if the matter were to be left to the conclusions of a judge based on ocular inspection. The geographical interpretation that ‘free white persons‘ mean persons of European habitancy and descent is at least capable of uniform application, and gives to the statute a construction that avoids the uncertainties of shades of color and invidious discriminations as to the race of individuals. Under the construction of the statute above fixed, a modern Syrian of Asiatic birth and descent would not be entitled under the statute of Congress to be naturalized as a citizen of the United States. The argument that such a construction would exclude persons coming from the very cradle of the Jewish and Christian religions, as professed by the nations of Europe whose descendants form the great bulk of the citizens of the United States, is unworthy of consideration. Such arguments are of the emotional ad captandum order, that have no place in the judicial interpretation of a statute. If the people of the United States, through their representatives in Congress, see fit to exclude by law from citizenship the most worthy and spiritual inhabitants of the globe, it is not for the courts by judicial legislation to gainsay that law, and substitute for it what in their opinion may be more appropriate and reasonable legislation. In the present case the applicant is not one the admission of whom to citizenship is likely to be for the benefit of the country and in favor of whom the court should exercise the power of discretion given under the statute, and in view of the great uncertainties resulting from the language of the statute and the unsatisfactory reasoning of most of the decisions, the court, without determining the general question *817 of admissibility, will rest its conclusion that the present applicant should not be admitted upon his own personal disqualifications. Ordered, that the application of the applicant be refused.This is an application for naturalization. The applicant is a native of a place called by him Batroun, in Syria in Asia. He has performed all the necessary formalities and would apparently from his intelligence and degree of information of a general character be entitled to naturalization. In color he is darker than the *487 usual person of white European descent, and of that tinged or sallow appearance which usually accompanies persons of descent other than purely European. His mental and other faculties, his information and general knowledge, and his residence in this country would entitle him, as before said, to naturalization, if he is entitled to naturalization under the terms of the act of Congress in that behalf. This matter was discussed by this court in the case of Ex parte Shahid (D.C.) 205 Fed. 812. The personal objections to the admission of Shahid and upon which his rejection was based in that decision do no apply to the present applicant. If rejected he can only be so upon the ground that under the statute by reason of his nativity and descent he is not entitled to be admitted as a citizen of this country, and the point therefore comes up squarely upon the question whether a Syrian of Asiatic birth and descent is entitled to be admitted a citizen. As stated in the case of Ex parte Shahid, this depends upon the construction of the clause in the statute which limits the classes entitled to naturalization, as follows: ‘The provisions of this title shall apply to aliens being free white persons, and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.‘ The applicant’s claim to admission is not upon the ground that he is either an alien of African nativity or a person of African descent. This part of the clause being excluded, his application depends upon whether he is a free white person. Is a Syrian of Asiatic birth a free white person within the meaning of the statute approved March 26, 1790? There have been discussions as to the construction to be given these words, which have treated it somewhat in three aspects: First. Do the words ‘free white persons‘ mean persons white in color? Is the definition to be determined by the colorization of the applicant to be ascertained by ocular inspection by the court? This definition, as determinable in the shape of the definition of color, has been by the great weight of authority under the decisions of the courts in this country rejected, and it has been held that the right of the applicant is not to be determined by the question whether or not upon ocular inspection he may in the opinion of the judge be actually white in color. Second. The next question is whether the definition is racial; that is, whether the words ‘white persons‘ are a racial designation. And that ‘white‘ is to be interpreted as meaning Caucasian, so called, or Indo-European. If racial, is any one entitled to be admitted who belongs to a nation that speaks one of the languages spoken by the peoples heretofore denominated Caucasian, whether or not his color be the very reverse of white. This would mean the admission of all the mixed Asiatic races which speak a tongue the descendant of one of the so-called Indo-European tongues, whether that tongue may have been forced upon them or inherited by a very mixed transmission in point of race. The dark colored, in fact, almost black, inhabitants of Ceylon, speak the Sinhalese language, which is one of the dialects of that branch of the ancient Indo-european language known as Sanscrit, and the dark colored inhabitants of the Persian Gulf or Persian Coast speak a tongue which appears to be the descendant of the ancient Iranian. If racial determination or definition is to be given to the *488 expression as limiting it to the Caucasian races, and the Caucasian race is to be determined philologically by the tongue spoken as Indo-European, then there are a number of European peoples who would be excluded, such as the Magyars, the Finns, the Turks, the Basques, and the Lapps. The language spoken, although a strong evidence as to the race of the speaker (and apparently the stronger the earlier in the period of the world’s history is the point of ascertainment), yet, as is known by modern examples, is not by any means conclusive. The negro occupants of the French West Indies speak a Latin tongue, and the negro occupants of the English West Indies a Saxon tongue, although racially not belonging to either race. History informs us that in many well-known instances the language of the conqueror has been imposed upon the conquered, and conversely the language of the conquered has been accepted by the conqueror, although of a wholly different race. In the case of the Hindu and the modern Persian by reason of the fact that their present speech is a descendant of an Indo-European tongue, they have been classed as ‘Aryan‘ or ‘Caucasian‘ brothers in the face of the proof historical and ethnological that they represent instances where the conqueror imposed his language upon a subject race into the mass of which eventually the smaller numerical body of conquerors has been submerged. The modern Egyptian to-day speaks an Arabian language that he has only acquired from his conquerors in comparatively recent times. To speak of the Asiatic inhabitants of Persia or India as ‘Aryan‘ or ‘Caucasian‘ is almost as great a contradiction as to call a negro inhabitant of South Africa a Saxon because he speaks English, or an Indian inhabitant of Peru or Mexico a Latin because he speaks Spanish. While there has been a great deal of difference and confusion about this point, owing in great measure to the apparent lack of conception of exactly what is meant by a Caucasian or Indo-European race, the general inclination would be to consider the definition of Caucasian as what is supposed to be meant by white. This, however, is very loose and indefinite, for the meaning of Caucasian as at one time prevalent has been now practically exploded. The meaning of Caucasian as so applied did not exist, generally speaking, at the time of the passage of the act of March 26, 1790, although it did afterwards obtain wide currency during the slavery and antislavery discussions which preceded the year 1860. Such a racial definition is very difficult, to say the least, of enforcement; for, as I have stated above, it is based upon a construction which would exclude some people generally known and termed as white, and include those who have been always considered as not forming a part of the white race. This definition might be termed a racial definition as against the first, which has been referred to as the definition of color. Third. The next definition may be termed a geographical one. Does the word ‘white‘ in the statute refer to the peoples who were then commonly known in this country as the peoples inhabiting Europe and whose descendants at the time of the passage of the act of 1790 formed the inhabitants of the United States, excluding from such consideration *489 the African descendants who were then slaves. If we give to the term ‘white‘ this geographical definition, that it means European, that ‘white‘ was used in the sense of European, the statute becomes one judicially speaking plain, understandable by the multitude as well as by the learned, and not difficult of enforcement. The words ‘free white persons‘ would then mean all the fair complexioned people of European habitancy and descent commonly termed in 1790 the white races. That would appear to be what was intended by the terms of the act of 1790. It intended under the reasoning set out in Ex parte Shahid, supra, to admit to citizenship in this country the people generally known as white; that is to say, the inhabitants of Europe and their descendants. This would include many people who would not come within the definition of Caucasian or Indo-European, but nevertheless it was the general understanding that the inhabitants of Europe who were the parents of the inhabitants of the United States were white people. In the opinion of the court this is the correct and proper construction of the statute. The meaning of free white persons in the statute is free persons of European habitancy or descent, and such, and such alone, are entitled to be admitted to naturalization under the terms of that clause of the statute. This exclusion is no reflection upon the applicant, intellectual, moral, or racial. It simply means that the lawmaking power has not seen fit to admit to citizenship, under the clause mentioned, persons other than of European habitancy or descent. The court has no hesitation in saying that the applicant now before it would apparently be qualified to form a more desirable citizen than very many of those we now have as citizens, whether by birth or naturalization. No race in modern times has shown a higher mentality than the Japanese. To refuse naturalization to an educated Japanese Christian clergyman and accord it to a veneered savage of African descent from the banks of the Congo would appear as illogical as possible, yet the courts of the United States have held the former inadmissible and the statute accords admission to the latter. This refusal is no reflection upon the excluded Japanese. The statute presents what may appear to be the startling discrimination that it forbids the privilege of citizenship to a Chinese or a Japanese descendant of two historic races that have accomplished so much in the constructive intellectual work of the world, and extends the privilege to a member of a savage negro tribe. The admission of a foreigner to the privilege of citizenship in a country is wholly a matter for the people of that country. They may be as capricious and unreasonable as they see fit about it. It is a voluntary donation to be extended or denied according to the whims of the donor if he shall see fit to allow his action to be controlled by caprice or whim. He has certainly a right to be controlled by his ideas of prudent or wise policy towards himself in making the donation. The present applicant may be a free white person. So also may be an individual Japanese or South Sea Islander. The court does not undertake to say what races of mankind in matter of complexion should or should not be classed as white. There is a vast range in shades of white between the Northern Scandinavian and the Southern Portuguese. *490 The only point decided is that the applicant is not that particular free white person to whom the act of Congress has donated the privilege of citizenship in this country with its accompanying duties and responsibilities. In donating this privilege the people of the United States have seen fit under the description of free white persons to restrict the privilege as extended to such foreigners to persons of European habitancy and European descent. The applicant being an Asiatic does not come within the terms of the statute, and, whatever may be his other qualifications, Congress has not seen fit to endow him with the right to be admitted a citizen of the country. For the reasons set out in this decree and the decree in Ex parte Shahid, supra, the application of the petitioner is refused.At the instance of the applicant and other Syrians interested, a rehearing was granted in this case, which has been had, and argument has been heard on behalf of the applicant himself as well as from counsel appearing on behalf of the Syrian American Associations of the country. Deep feeling has been manifested on the part of the Syrian immigrants because of what has been termed by them the humiliation inflicted upon, and mortification suffered by, Syrians in America by the previous decree in this matter which they construe as deciding that they do not (as they term it) belong to the ‘white race.‘ In the first place, such was not the decision of this court. The decision of the court in this case was that a modern Syrian was an Asiatic, and was thus not included in the term ‘white persons‘ as contained in section 2169 of the U.S. revised Statutes as amended in 1875, and first used in the Statute of 1790. In the second place, there was no justifiable reason for either humiliation or mortification. The grant of the privilege of citizenship is purely discretionary with the people of the country. It is entirely distinct from the admitting to entry and residence. It carries with it great powers of good and evil in the exercise of the ballot and great responsibilities in the duties of the jury box. The immigrant such as the present applicant is freely admitted here. He comes from a land where he deems himself oppressed, to a free country where he is allowed to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in as full democratic measure as the citizens of the country themselves. That he should further be allowed to take part in the government as a voter and exercise the weighty judicial powers of a juror is an entirely different matter. That this should be refused to him is no real ground for humiliation. Congress has admittedly seen fit to exclude from that privilege Chinese, Japanese, Malays, Mongols generally, and American Indians. It is no more a humiliation for a Syrian to be excluded from a privilege (not a right) than it is to an educated and cultivated person from China, Japan, or the Malay Peninsula. The true ground of this supposed humiliation is that the applicant and his associates conceive the refusal of this privilege to mean that they do not belong to a white race, but to a colored and what they consider an inferior race. The inconsistency of this attitude is apparent. The statute does admit to citizenship the very race they term inferior. It admits persons of ‘African nativity and African descent.‘ So that if the applicant and his associates did belong to *357 the race they so deem inferior, they could be admitted to that very privilege the refusal of which so humiliates them. The admitting a black African and excluding a brown Asiatic may be arbitrary and unreasonable, but it cannot be said to be humiliating, and at any rate it is certainly a matter wholly for Congress in its pure discretion. It may be that in 1870 when Congress enlarged the provisions of the statute as to aliens who could be naturalized by extending the privilege to persons of African nativity, and African descent, it considered that the immigration of that character would be inconsiderable, whereas if it opened the privilege to persons of Asiatic nativity and Asiatic descent it might be overwhelming; but that conclusion cannot be said to involve any humiliation to the Asiatic. The previous decision in this case was that the term ‘white persons,‘ as used in the statute, meant persons of European nativity or European descent. The applicant was excluded because he was an Asiatic and not an European. Whether he belonged to a white race or not was not decided as not pertinent to the issue. The applicant and his associates now seek to have that decision reconsidered and reversed upon the following grounds: (1) That the term ‘white persons‘ in the statute means persons of the ‘Caucasian race,‘ and not persons white in color. (2) That he is a Semite or a member of one of the Semitic nations. (3) That the Semitic nations are all members of the ‘Caucasian‘ or white race. (4) That the matter has been settled in their favor as the European Jews have been admitted without question since the passage of the statute and that the Jews are one of the Semitic peoples. (5) That the history and position of the Syrians, their connection through all time with the peoples to whom the Jewish and Christian peoples owe their religion, make it inconceivable that the statute could have intended to exclude them. The judge upon an application for naturalization is called upon to pass upon the question whether the applicant is entitled under the terms of the statute. The present applicant denies that he is a person of African nativity or African descent. He asserts that he is a person of Asiatic nativity and of Asiatic descent. The question is then presented to the court whether such an Asiatic is a white person as intended by the statute. At first reading the term ‘white‘ denotes color. Construed literally the statute might be interpreted to mean such a person as under the ocular inspection of the court seemed to be white in color. What standard of ‘white‘ is the judge to adopt? The clear white of a Scandinavian, or the swarthy olive or brown of a person from the south of Portugal? Disease and other causes sometimes cloud and darken the fairest skin and lighten the darkest. It is manifest that it would be absolutely impossible for a judge to determine whether an applicant is a white person by ocular inspection. Again, out of the multitude of *358 judges in this country, how could there be any uniform rule under such a test? No two judges would agree upon the same standard or grade of colorization. The spectacle would be presented of one judge excluding and another admitting persons of the same grade of complexion. For these and other similar reasons the strict ‘color test‘ as the test under the statute has been repudiated by the courts of the country. As a substitute for this test, some courts have followed in a way what may be termed the test of race. In other words, the words ‘white persons‘ have been construed as meaning persons of the ‘white race,‘ and it has been held that if a person belonged to a so-called white race he was entitled to naturalization, no matter what his complexion. What is the white race? Or what was known as the white race in 1790? Most of the courts in this country that have attempted to deal with the question have referred to the white race as the ‘Caucasian‘ race, and said that a member of the Caucasian race was entitled to be naturalized without regard to complexion. Very few agree as to what peoples are members of the Caucasian race, and the term ‘Caucasian‘ received its wide currency in the United States largely from the fact that for 70 years after the statute of 1790 a large number of persons of a black complexioned race were held as slaves, and one of the justifications advanced was that they did not belong to the superior race which was styled Caucasian supposing that term referred to white. The term ‘Caucasian‘ in its application to race originated with one Blumenbach, who in 1781 published in German a work attempting to classify the races of mankind in which he classed as ‘Caucasian‘ the inhabitants of Europe and of the Caucasus and of Asia Minor, Western Asia including Syria, and of Northern Africa. Blumenbach determined his classification neither by complexion nor by philological or scientific ethnological principles as now understood. He put together as one race in his own words ‘altogether the inhabitants of the world known by the ancient Grecians and Romans.‘ The peoples possessing according to Blumenbach ‘according to European ideas of beauty the form of the face and skull most perfect.‘ For the designation ‘Caucasian‘ he was indebted to the following circumstances: ‘Of all the odd myths that have arisen in the scientific world, the ‘Caucasian mystery’ invented quite innocently by Blumenbach is the oldest. A Georgian woman’s skull was the handsomest in his collection. Hence it became his model exemplar of human skulls, from which all others might be regarded as derivations; and out of this, by some strange intellectual hocus-pocus, grew up the notion that the Caucasian man is the prototypic ‘Adamic’ man and his country the primitive center of our kind.‘ Huxley, Methods & Results of Ethnology (Ed. of 1894). Or as said by Latham: ‘Blumenbach had a solitary Georgian skull and that skull was the finest in his collection, that of a Greek being the next. Hence it was taken as the type of the skull of the more organized division of our species. More than this, it gave its name to the type and introduced the term Caucasian. Never has a single head done more harm to science than was done in the way of posthumous mischief by this well-shaped head of a female from Georgia.‘ Latham, ‘The Nationalities of Europe.‘ The scientific conclusion of scholars of the present day is that the inhabitants of the Caucasus are to be classed with the Mongols, and not with the Europeans, so that Blumenbach derived his term from a skull more likely to have been Mongolian than European, or it may be the skull of some traveler or captive in the Caucasus. ‘The ill chosen name of Caucasian invented by Blumenbach in allusion to a South Caucasian skull of especially typical proportions, and applied by him to the so-called white races, is still current; it brings into one race peoples such as the Arabs and Swedes, although these are scarcely less different than the Americans and Malays who are set down as two distinct races.‘ E. B. Tylor in article on Anthropology, Encyclo. Brit. (11th Ed.). Subsequent to 1781, and Blumenbach’s ill-chosen classification, came the great development of philological study initiated by the acquisition of the Sanscrit and Zendic or Iranian languages. The discovery that Sanscrit, the ancient language of Northern India, and Zend or Iranian, the ancient language of Northern Persia held affinities of a definite character with Gothic, Celtic, Slavonic, Latin, and Greek, stimulated the scientific study of philology, and its inferences carried to an extreme, persuaded many to determine racial by language affinities, wholly oblivious of the fact that there are many instances where a language of one race has been imposed upon or accepted by those of another race. This philological development led to the coining of the word ‘Aryan,‘ taken from the Vedic or old Sanscrit and Zend, and all persons speaking or having spoken one of the so-called ‘Aryan‘ tongues, i.e., one of the Sanscrit, Iranian, Slavonic, Gothic, Celtic, Latin, Greek group of languages were called ‘Aryans‘ and recognized as belonging to a white race, leading to the manifest absurdity of classing among whites the black Dravidian inhabitant of Ceylon and Southern India, because he spoke a dialect or descendant of Sanscrit, and the almost equally dark inhabitant of Southern Persia because he spoke a modern Persian dialect or descendant of ancient Iranian, and excluded from the ‘Aryan brotherhood‘ of whites the Magyars, the Finns, and the Turks because they spoke tongues of the Ugric or Turanian group, and the Basques because they spoke a language of a kind all to itself. The ethnological and historical absurdity of this became apparent. The history of India showed that a conquering white complexioned race had imposed their language upon a dark complexioned race now called Dravidian, and had become submerged into its enormously preponderant population, notwithstanding the determined effort to prevent it by the institution of a rigid system of caste; and that a similar result had taken place in Persia. The term ‘Aryan‘ has thus become more or less discredited, and has been (at least in its application to the family of languages) succeeded largely by that of Indo-European. During this philological-ethnological attempt to adapt present physical conditions to past linguistic ones, the point of supposed original distribution of the white races shifted. Blumenbach, who does not appear to have known either the Sanscrit or Iranian tongues, placed it in the Caucasus. His successors— whom Huxley calls ‘brilliant Uhlans‘— removed it to the Hindoo-Koosh-Pamir region, the *360 supposed home of the speakers of Vedic and Zend, and Latham attempts to place it on the Sarmatian plains. Ethnologists and philologists do not agree as to this, nor do they agree as to who are the white races. They will rank different peoples as ‘Aryans‘ or ‘Indo-Europeans‘ or ‘Semites‘ or ‘Hamites,‘ differing even as to who are included in these; but when it comes to ‘white‘ no agreed classification exists. The term white is generally joined to some other by the word ‘or,‘ viz., Aryans or white races, etc. If there be no such race as the ‘Caucasian race,‘ and the term Caucasian be incorrect as properly describing the white races, then the whole argument based upon the Syrian being one of a Caucasian race falls to the ground. It may be added that up to this time neither history nor archeological investigations seem to show that any Semitic speaking race came from the Caucasian region. Their recorded movements are apparently from the south and the east. A Syrian not only would not appear to be of a Caucasian race, but it does not appear clear that he is of a Semitic race. The applicant and his friends claim among other grounds to be Semites because they speak a so-called Semitic tongue, viz., Arabic. The Berbers and Moors of Northern Africa and the modern Egyptians also speak Arabic, yet none of them are classed as Semites. Does the history of Syria bear out their contention? By Syria is generally included all that part of Asia lying east of the Mediterranean Sea, south of the Amanus branch of the Taurus range of mountains, west of the Arabian or Syrian desert, and north of the boundary of Egypt, say north of a point somewhat over 100 miles south of Jerusalem. It is exceedingly difficult to trace the ‘origin‘ of any very ancient people, but when history opens, this region seems, according to present acceptance, to have been in possession of a people called Hittites or ‘Khatti.‘ Their language is still a mystery, but from their sculptured representations and the few proper names that survive in other languages, and their pictured representations on extant sculptures, they are generally supposed to have been a non-Semitic, possibly a Mongolic race. The central and southern part of this region next apparently was under Egyptian rule. Whether that rule was only that of a military government or tax gatherer, or included any interpenetration of Egyptian settlers, it does not seem possible to say. This rule in turn seems to have been succeeded by another Hittite dominion. It does appear that subsequent thereto occupation was taken by people speaking a Semitic tongue. The Phoenicians first, and with them apparently Arameans, and then the Hebrews. Whether this was a complete dispossession or an amalgamation of the conquerors with the Hittite population, the latter taking the language of their masters, cannot yet be told. It has been suggested that it was this Hittite peoples of a different race (the accursed inhabitants of Canaan) that the invading Hebrew was told so savagely to destroy. Deut. vii, 2, and xx, 16, 17. The historical record in the Old Testament tells us that nothwithstanding this injunction many of the inhabitants were spared and continued *361 to occupy the land, afterwards the land ruled by the Hebrews, and doubtless to mix and amalgamate with their conquerors. As the mist clears, the Hittite dominion overthrown, we find the country as to the southern part in Hebrew hands, as to the coast and center in Phoenician, and as to the north, toward Damascus and beyond in what may be termed Aramean, or according to Winckler, mixed Hittite and Aramean, but all speaking a Semitic language. Then come the invasions: First, the Assyrian with its recorded depopulation, and the removal of the people and the substitution of others. Next, the Babylonian, with a like sequence, intermixed with Egyptian inroads, and then the Persian, to the clemency of whose sovereigns according to the Bible record was due the restoration of the Jew to Jerusalem, surrounded by a population whose race and descent is not known, but who were apparently not regarded by the Jews as a part of them. After the Persian dominion, came the conquest of Alexander, and the overlordship of his successors, during whose dominion parts of the country seem to have been largely Hellenized, both in immigration and language. Large parts of Syria were inhabited by a Greek speaking people (although not necessarily of Greek descent), and the words of Christ though supposed to have been spoken in Aramaeic have been transmitted (excepting His last words on the cross) to us in Greek. Then came the Roman conquest, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the devastation of the country and wasting of the people that preceded the Pax Romana. Greek influences seem to have continued and Greek overlordship held good under the Byzantine Emperors, varied only by temporary raids and control of the Persian Sasanians until the Arabian Mohammedan storm swept over the land in the seventh century, crushing and killing all that opposed. Then followed the crusades, with the temporary Latin military occupation of Jerusalem and a small part of lower Syria for about a century, and in 1260 the terrible and ruthless Mongolian invasions under the dynasty of Jenghis Khan, that invasion which literally destroyed Bagdad and its inhabitants and largely populated Persia with a Mongol people. And then finally, in 1516, the Turkish victory over the Arabic overlordship and the Turkish conquest and occupation of the country. Now of what race are the Syrians? They no longer speak Hittite or Phoenician or Syriac or Greek; they speak Arabic, but that does not show them to be Semites, for so do the Berbers and Moors and Egyptians of North Africa. They are not Aryan or Indo-European. They may be a mixture of every race that has possessed the country. How large the Turkish and Mongolian intermixture may be cannot be told. Syria, according to the accounts, varies: In the north its inhabitants are Turkish more or less mixed. In the south its inhabitants are Arabian largely mixed with African blood. In the center is the Lebanon District, the ancient Phoenician country, from which the applicant comes. This is largely inhabited by the peoples known as Maronites, who are Christian, and the Druses, who are Mahommedan of a *362 peculiar sect. Both speak Arabic-- an impure Arabic according to some travelers. The present applicant comes from Batrun or Batroun on the coast of the Lebanon District. That is, he comes from the coast in ancient times occupied by the Phoenicians. Batroun is between Beirout and Tripoli near the site of the ancient but long destroyed Phoenician city of Gebal, called by the Greeks Byblos. He is a Maronite— a Christian. The inhabitants of this region are said by some accounts to average lighter in color than the inhabitants of the rest of Syria, although there are many dark ones among them. The Mahommedan Druses are said to be lighter than the Maronites, but taken as a whole the inhabitants of this district are very considerably darker in complexion than Europeans. Their complexions are said to have a yellowish tinge more characteristic of the Turk and Mongol than the olive of southern Europe or the brown of the Arab. And these accounts agree with the appearance of the usual Syrian immigrant in this country with some striking exceptions. The representatives of the Syrians before the court have claimed that their features show them to be of Semitic race, but the presiding judge confesses himself unable to say that such is the case, and equally unable to say, from ocular inspection as well as from the historical facts so far as they exist, whether the modern Syrian is basally in race a Hittite, a Phoenician, an Aramaean, an Arabian, or a Mongolian, or a compound of all. The mere fact of habitancy in a country once occupied by another race is not of itself proof of descent from that race. The Mongol or Bedouin herdsman who occupies the sites of those cities is not thereby entitled to claim descent from the builders of Nineveh and Babylon. The modern swart Arabic speaking fellahin of modern Egypt is not from that circumstance alone to be taken as a descendant from the builders of the Pyramids and the carvers of the hieroglyphic writings. There is no known ocular, microscopic, philological, ethnological, physiological, or historical test that can settle the question of the race of the modern Syrian; but the applicant and his associates are certainly Asiatics in the sense that they are of Asian nativity and descent and are not Europeans. There is no known reason based on physiological or philological data for joining the Semitic races to the Indo-European races as one branch or variety of the human race greater than there is for joining the Turanian races to them. The reason why Blumenbach and his school joined them does not seem to have been on grounds of complexion or language, but because they had been in historical contact and seemed to share a common spiritual and intellectual heritage, a wholly misleading circumstance. The beginnings of modern civilization, according to recent archaeological discoveries, go back to Ancient Babylonia and Ancient Egypt, where apparently independently the arts and practices from which have developed modern civilization, learning, and religious exercises, first took definite shape. Yet the first beginners in Babylonia were Sumerians or Akkadians, an apparently non-Indo-European and non- *363 Semitic race, and the first Egyptians were also of another race now called the Hamitic. And neither of these races would now be claimed as either white or Caucasian. The so-called Semitic races may be superior races to the so-called Indo-European. Their spiritual and intellectual legacy to the world may be of a higher value, but these circumstances do not justify their inclusion with the latter as one branch to be styled Caucasian and the exclusion of other races. When it comes down to strict logical analysis, the inhabitant of Syria, if he cannot rest on complexion, must find other grounds than race, habitancy, or language, to establish any community of race with the European races assuming those last to be the white race. The claim that the admission of the European Jew to citizenship would include the admission of the Syrian, as both are Semites, is not apparently well founded under either the racial or geographical interpretation of ‘white persons‘ in the statute. It is most difficult, according to ethnological authorities, to attempt to class the European Jew as a separate people in any racial sense. The term Jew as applied to Europeans means as a rule a religious not a racial distinction. The European Jews have many of them resided longer in their present European quarters than the Christian nations among whom they live. The Jew in Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Hungary may well have been there before the Goth, the Visigoth, the Lombards, the Vandals, and the Huns overran those countries. The European Jew has become racially, physiologically, and psychologically a part of the peoples he lives among. He speaks their tongues, he thinks their thoughts, and his blood is as intermingled with theirs as theirs is with his. No one can tell how much Jewish blood has been incorporated with the Christian peoples of modern Europe, and no one can tell how much so-called Aryan blood runs in the veins of the modern European Jew. He varies in complexion as much as other Europeans. The Jew of Northern Germany and Northern Russia is frequently blue eyed and fair haired. The Jew of Spain and Portugal is as dark as his fellow citizens. The modern European Jew is practically the same as any other modern European. The theory that the modern European Jew has as a general rule any marked difference in physiognomy differentiating him as a ‘Semite‘ from other Europeans has after careful examination been discarded. But there are communities professing the Jewish religion in North Africa and the east who are as dark as Negroes or the peoples among whom they live, and who probably by intermixture of blood are physiologically the same. The European Jew is as white as the peoples among whom he lives, and the African or Asiatic Jew as dark. The exclusion of the last two has no connection with the admission of the first. A professing Jew from Syria who was not of European nativity or descent would be as equally an Asiatic as the present applicant, and as such not within the terms of the statute. The other arguments based upon the particular merits of the inhabitants of the Lebanon District of Syria and the inferences to be drawn *364 from the fact that the Jewish and Christian religions took their rise among peoples at that time inhabiting Syria are appeals to considerations to be addressed to Congress and not to a court of law. The modern inhabitant of the Lebanon District, it may, however, be said, does not inhabit the scene either of the followers of the religion exhibited in the Old Testament or of the labors of Christ. That is the southern part of Syria commonly called Palestine. The coast of the Lebanon District is Phoenicia, whose inhabitants, so far from professing the monotheistic and ethical tenets of the Old Testament, were the followers prior to their conversion to Christianity of rites and beliefs held up as among the most repulsive (according to modern ideas) of all those of the ancient historical worlds. Let it be as claimed in the argument for the applicant that Christ appeared in the form of the Jew and spoke a Semitic language. The apostrophic utterance that He cannot be supposed to have clothed His Divinity in the body of one of a race that an American Congress would not admit to citizenship is purely emotional and without logical sequence. The test imposed by Congress is not a religious one. The matter regulated is a purely secular domestic one. The pertinent statement rather is that a dark complexioned present inhabitant of what formerly was ancient Phoenicia is not entitled to the inference that he must be of the race commonly known as the white race in 1790, merely because 2,000 years ago Judea, a country whose inhabitants have since entirely changed, was the scene of the labor of one who proclaimed that He had come to save from spiritual destruction all mankind. An attempt to consider the question on racial lines reveals to the investigator how difficult it is to come to any conclusion as to the nationalities of Europe alone. It may be that there are some Scandinavian or Slavonic communities that are comparatively of pure blood, but it is beyond human power to say how much Tartar blood there is in Russia; how much Slavonic blood in Prussia, and Germany generally; how much Teutonic and Celtic blood in France; how much Celtic and Iberian blood in Ireland; how much Celtic, Latin, and Saxon blood in England; how much Iberian, Celtic, Gothic, Arabic, and Moorish blood in Spain; how much blood from the ancient historical world in Italy; how much European blood there is in the European Jew; and how much Jewish blood in all Europe. If this be true as to Europe, the difficulties appear infinitely greater with regard to Asia, and its mixed peoples of every shade except white. The conclusion is that it becomes a matter of futile speculation. The broad fact remains that the European peoples taken as a whole are the fair skinned or light complexioned races of the world, and form the peoples generally referred to as ‘white‘ and so classed since classification based on complexion was adopted. All of which foregoing discussion may seem wholly out of place in a reasoned legal opinion as to the construction of a statute, except as illustrating the Serbonian bog into which a court or judge will plunge that attempts to make the words ‘white persons‘ conform to any racial classification. *365 The real question is: What does the statute mean, to whom did the terms ‘free white persons‘ refer in 1790, in the understanding of the makers of the law? Blumenbach’s ‘Caucasian‘ classification was certainly not generally known or current in the United States in 1790. His work was not translated into English and published until 1807, and then it was published in London. The United States had been settled by European peoples. They were in 1790 a busy, occupied, hardworking people, with very few libraries, few colleges, and not many schools. It is safe to assume that no member of the congress that passed the act of 1790 knew either Sanscrit or ancient Persian, or had the remotest idea of the connection between the Aryan or Indo-European languages. He would certainly have repudiated the idea that a black Ceylonese or a dark South Persian was in the language of the enthusiastic supporters of the theory that all speakers of Aryan languages are of one race, an ‘Aryan brother.‘ His general idea of Western Asia generally was that it was ruled by the ‘Grand Turk‘ or the ‘Sublime Porte,‘ and inhabited by Turks and Mohammedans of the pernicious and obnoxious nature of the inhabitants of the Barbary States. American missionaries had not yet penetrated those mystic regions, and brought back accounts of the peoples who inhabited them. All the average citizen of the states knew of Syria was derived from Greek and Latin historians, perhaps supplemented by Rollin’s History, or some other synopsis of the same kind, followed by the impression from the history of the crusades that the Mohammedan or Saracenic conquest had obliterated the ancient inhabitants. All the world was foreign, unknown, and black to him except the American Indians (whom he counted almost as vermin) and the inhabitants of Europe, from whence he or his fathers came. He neither expected nor desired immigrants from any other quarter. Certainly not from Syria, the emigration whence has only been of late years. He never saw or heard of elaborate classification of mankind based on skulls or languages or measurements of the tibia or toes. His only classification was ‘color.‘ The belief in the descent of all men from Adam still was accepted. The rightfulness of slavery as approved by all ancient codes, including the Old Testament, was also still generally accepted in America, although by many it was then accompanied with the modification that the right must be exercised by a superior over an inferior race. The average citizen of the states was at that time firmly convinced of the superiority of his own white European race over the rest of the world, whether red, yellow, brown, or black. He had enslaved many of the American Indians on that ground. He would have enslaved a Moor, a Bedouin, a Syrian, a Turk, or an East Indian of sufficiently dark complexion with equal readiness on the same plea if he could have caught him. The opposite west coast of Africa was accessible for the slave supply; the other sources were not, and the trader who went to get his slaves from them was likely to be made a slave himself. So far as the knowledge of the writer of this opinion goes, the person in public political life who appears from written expressions to  *366 have had any extended idea on the subject and who may have doubted the descent of all men from Adam was Thomas Jefferson, and he doubted it with Voltaire on general principles of reason, and not on the scientific arguments of to-day, and Jefferson was not a member of the Congress that passed the statute of 1790. ‘White persons,‘ therefore, to the average citizen of the United States in 1790, would seem to have meant Europeans, and when he used the words ‘aliens being free white persons‘ he could only have referred to Europeans. With this interpretation of the statute the eligibility of any applicant for naturalization on this ground can be determined by a fixed uniform rule. The judge need neither examine his complexion with a microscope nor measure his skull or his limbs or features, nor inquire into his paternity and maternity for past several generations. The test becomes mainly one of geography. Is the applicant from Europe and a member of the peoples inhabiting Europe, and there regarded as white, or a descendent of an emigrant from them? If he is, he is entitled to naturalization if he be otherwise fit for it. If he is not, if he is an Asiatic, whether Chinese, Japanese, Hindoo, Parsee, Persian, Mongol, Malay, or Syrian, he is not entitled to the privilege of naturalization, no matter what his fitness otherwise may be. The argument that the statute as it stands may be arbitrary, illogical, unjust, even absurd in its provisions, in that it makes color, race, or geographical habitancy, and not moral and mental merit, the basis for granting the privilege of citizenship, is one to be addressed to Congress and not to a court of law. Nothing could be more difficult and invidious for a court to attempt than to determine an applicant’s right to naturalization upon any ground of complexion or race. No matter who may be refused, if the applicant does not apply on the basis of being of African nativity or African descent, the refusal is construed as meaning that the applicant is not a white person and is therefore of an inferior race. Still the statute is there and requires the court to exclude the applicant unless he be a ‘white person‘ and it is the duty of the judge to obey. Under the construction of the statute as it appears to this court to be based on reason, authority, and the history of the legislation, the difficulty disappears and the refusal can carry no sting to the applicant, whether a Syrian or a Japanese. For the reasons stated in this opinion and in the former opinion in this case, filed February 18, 1914, and reported (D.C.) 211 Fed. 486, and in the opinion in Re Shahid, filed June 24, 1913, and reported in (D.C.) 205 Fed. 812, all of which should be read and taken together as forming the final conclusion and decision of the court, the order made refusing the application on the ground that the applicant is an Asiatic is affirmed. Whether he is of a white race, or whether the modern Syrians are racially or intrinsically free white persons, or whether any other Asiatic people is also of white race, is not decided as not pertinent to the issues of the application. All that the court decides is that the applicant, not being of European nativity or descent, *367 is not a white person within the meaning of the naturalization statute. As the matter involves the construction of a statute law of the United States, it is to be hoped that an appeal from this order will be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States and a settlement had of this most vexed and difficult question.[1] The appellant, George Dow, a Syrian, was denied naturalization on the sole ground that a Syrian of Asiatic birth is not a free white person within the meaning of the naturalization statute. After the first decision of the matter a rehearing was granted at the instance of other Syrians interested. In his two opinions the District Judge reached the conclusion, which he supported with remarkable force and learning, that the ‘free white persons‘ made eligible to naturalization by the statute included aliens of European nativity or descent, and no others. \\xa0 The statute of 1790, with which legislation on the subject began, *146 provided ‘that any alien being a free white person may be admitted to become a citizen,‘ etc. The subject of naturalization was before Congress on propositions for amendment or repeal and re-enactment of existing laws in 1795, 1798, 1802, 1813, 1814, 1816, 1824, 1828, 1848, 1862, 1867, 1868, 1873, 1874, 1875, 1876, 1882, 1894, 1898, and 1903. The section with which we are concerned now stands in these words: ‘Sec. 2169. The provisions of this title shall apply to aliens being free white persons and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.‘ In 1790, when the first act was passed, immigration to this country was almost altogether from Europe; and doubtless the act of 1790 was intended mainly to provide for naturalization of aliens from Europe, and to deny naturalization to negroes. With other peoples this country had little intercourse and little concern. Accordingly the records of Congress indicate that the debates on the bill of 1790 related to European immigration. It is reasonably certain that congressmen had no knowledge of Blumenbach’s classification of the races of men published in 1781, in which he makes one of the divisions the white or Caucasian race and includes in it ‘the western Asiatics on this side of the Caspian Sea and the Ganges‘; for his work was not translated from the German and published in English until 1807. The science of ethnology had made little advance in 1790, and the notion of racial division and the meaning of the term ‘white‘ in a comprehensive sense as applied to men were probably quite vague and indefinite in the minds of legislators. Yet in not mentioning the people of Europe, and in extending the privilege of naturalization to any ‘free white person,‘ it seems reasonable to think that the Congress must have believed that there were white persons natives of countries outside of Europe. The writers on the subject of that day, to say the least, were not agreed in the view that Europeans were the only white people. If it be assumed, however, that the preponderance of the argument is strongly in favor of the conclusion that in 1790 the popular understanding was that people of European nativity or descent were white, and that all others were colored, and that legislators had not in definite view any persons as white, except those of European nativity or descent, that would not be conclusive of the construction to be given to the present statute. The popular conception of race division became more distinct as time went on. Blumenbach’s work probably became known in this country soon after 1807, when it was published in English; and his division, though the basis of it is now discarded, seems to have been that generally accepted. The opinions of later writers are in accord with Blumenbach’s that Syrians are to be classed as white people. Pritchard, Natural History of Man, 1848; Pickering, Races of Man, 1851; Figuier, The Human Race, 1872; Jeffries, Natural History of the Human Race, 1869; Brinton, Races and Peoples, 1901; Keane, World’s Peoples, 1908. In the Dictionary of Races, contained in the Reports of the Immigration Commission, 1911, it is said: *147 ‘Physically the modern Syrians are of mixed Syrian, Arabian, and even Jewish blood. They belong to the Semitic branch of the Caucasian race, thus widely differing from their rulers, the Turks, who are in origin Mongolian.‘ We have, then, this condition: That in the numerous reconsiderations of the statute, when it was amended or repealed and re-enacted, the Congress must have been aware that certain Asiatics, near the Mediterranean Sea, including Syrians, were generally classed as white people. It seems to follow that, even if the Congress of 1790 considered that the law of that year would be understood to allow the naturalization of persons of European nativity or descent only, the legislators of later years could not have supposed that the term ‘free white persons‘ would carry that restricted meaning. This growth of popular and legislative conception of the meaning of ‘free white persons‘ from 1790 to 1875, the date of the last enactment on the subject, is the controlling factor in ascertaining the meaning legislators intended should be given to the words as they stand in the present law. In addition to amendments at various times on other points, there was a repeal and a new statute in 1802, and partial repeals and new statutes in 1824 and 1828. In 1870 there was a vigorous debate on the proposition to amend the law by striking out altogether the limitation to ‘free white persons,‘ so that all aliens without regard to race could be naturalized. This proposed amendment was defeated, but it resulted in the extension of the privilege of naturalization to ‘aliens of African nativity and African descent.‘ In 1873 the report of the committee on revision of the laws omitted the limiting words, ‘free white persons.‘ This report was adopted, and the limitation was thus removed, with the result that an alien of any race could obtain naturalization. Upon discovery of the omission in 1874, the Congress amended the law in 1875 by inserting the limiting words, ‘being free white persons and aliens.‘ Certainly it cannot be said that, after all this legislative discussion and reconsideration and enactment, the present statute must be construed in the light of the knowledge and conception of the legislators who passed the original statute in 1790, without respect to the more definite and general knowledge and conception which must be attributed to the legislators who, upon reconsideration of the whole subject, enacted subsequent statutes including that now in force. [2] [3] A repealed statute has no force, and in arriving at the meaning of words used in a new statute the court must look to the meaning which the words had at the time of the new enactment. It is true that, if the words used in the old statute had received authoritative interpretation at the time they were used in the new statute, that meaning would be held to be carried into the new statute. But in this instance there had been no authoritative construction before the repeals and new enactments above set forth. In the absence of such prior construction, the court must take into account the history of legislation, and be controlled by the generally accepted meaning of the words used at the time of the passage of the new statute. *148 Bate Refrigerating Co. v. Sulzberger, 157 U.S. 1, 15 Sup.Ct. 508, 39 L.Ed. 601; Cambria Iron Co. v. Ashburn, 118 U.S. 54, 6 Sup.Ct. 929, 30 L.Ed. 60. \\xa0 At the date of the new acts and amendments, especially the act of 1873, with its amendment of 1875, it seems to be true beyond question that the generally received opinion was that the inhabitants of a portion of Asia, including Syria, were to be classed as white persons. It is true that Syria and the contiguous countries of Asia near the Mediterranean have been subjected to many changes in their inhabitants through conquest and other causes, and that the present inhabitants have racial descent from many different sources. Yet, as the consensus of opinion at the time of the enactment of the statute now in force was that they were so closely related to their neighbors on the European side of the Mediterranean that they should be classed as white, they must be held to fall within the term ‘white persons‘ used in the statute. The statute has been given this more liberal construction, so as to include within the term ‘white persons‘ Syrians, Armenians, and Parsees. In re Halladjian (C.C.) 174 Fed. 834; In re Najour (C.C.) 174 Fed. 735; In re Mudarri (C.C.) 176 Fed. 465; In re Ellis (D.C.) 179 Fed. 1002; In re Balsara, 180 Fed. 694, 103 C.C.A. 660. And it seems that in accordance with this construction of the statute a large number of Syrians have been naturalized without question. It is significant that, in view of these decisions and this practice of the courts, the Congress has not seen fit to change the law Reversed.Petitioner is an Arab, being a native of Yemen, located in the southwestern part of the Arabian peninsula. Petitioner was before the court and his skin was undisputedly dark brown in color. The issue here presented is whether petitioner is a ‘white person‘ within the meaning of the provisions of the Nationality Code enumerating the classes of people who are eligible for citizenship in the United States. 8 U.S.C.A. § 703. Affidavits filed by petitioner and one other person state that the extremely dark complexion of petitioner’s skin is typical of a majority of the Arabians from the region from which he comes, which fact is attributed to the intense heat *845 and the blazing sun of that area. Petitioner claims that, as has been established by ethnologists, the Arabs are remote descendants of and therefore members of the Caucasian or white race, and that he is therefore eligible for citizenship. [1] [2] [3] The decisions of the Supreme Court in United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, 261 U.S. 204, 43 S.Ct. 338, 67 L.Ed. 616; and Ozawa v. United States, 260 U.S. 178, 43 S.Ct. 65, 67 L.Ed. 199, interpreting the statute in question, control the result here. In those cases, the court held that the statute imported a racial rather than an individual test, the actual color of the skin of the particular individual not being decisive; that the phrase ‘white person‘ was generally synonymous with that of a member of the Caucasian race, as popularly understood; and that scientific or ethnological classifications of races were not significant in the application of the act. In the Thind case, the court pointed out that the framers of the statute in employing the term ‘white persons‘ had primarily in mind European peoples, who constituted the class from which virtually all of the immigration to this country had come and who readily became assimilated into our civilization. It accordingly held that the petitioner therein, a high caste Hindu, who claimed to be of Caucasian race from a scientific classification based upon remote ancestry, was not eligible for citizenship. The court indicated serious doubt as to whether any peoples of Asiatic stock could be considered white persons within the meaning of the statute, but left open for future determination the question of whether some Asiatics might be so closely related to Europeans as to be eligible for citizenship. \\xa0 It appears that the status of an Arabian under the act has not been definitely settled by the courts. The decision of this court in United States v. Ali, 7 F.2d 728, is not precisely in point, because the defendant Ali in that case at the time he was admitted to citizenship claimed to be a high caste Hindu, but later in the proceedings to cancel his citizenship claimed that although he was a native of India he was an Arabian of Arabian blood from remote ancestry. [4] [5] [6] [7] Consideration of the question leads to the conclusion that petitioner is not eligible for citizenship in the United States. The court is of the opinion that when one seeking citizenship is in fact clearly not white of skin a strong burden of proof devolves upon him to establish that he is a white person within the meaning of the act. It would appear that petitioner’s skin is of somewhat darker complexion than that of many Arabs. However, this court does not rest its decision on that ground, but rather upon the ground that Arabs as a class are not white and therefore not eligible for citizenship. In view of the evident intent of Congress, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the Thind case, supra, the court should be presented with a convincing case before it holds a person of Asiatic stock to be white. Apart from the dark skin of the Arabs, it is well known that they are a part of the Mohammedan world and that a wide gulf separates their culture from that of the predominately Christian peoples of Europe. It cannot be expected that as a class they would readily intermarry with our population and be assimilated into our civilization. The small amount of immigration of these peoples to the United States is in itself evidence of that fact. Arabia, moreover, is not immediately contiguous to Europe or even to the Mediterranean. It is true that most of the Arabian peninsula (including Yemen) is outside the zone from which Asiatic immigration to this country is excluded, and the Supreme Court in the Thind case pointed out that Congress could not have intended that natives from the excluded zone could become American citizens. However, it does not follow that all those outside the excluded zone are white persons under the act. \\xa0 [8] [9] [10] [11] To summarize the approach which must be followed in deciding whether a particular person applying for citizenship is a ‘white person‘ within the meaning of the statute, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, it is necessary to determine first the particular group or racial subdivision to which the individual belongs. In practical effect, proof of this fact is a matter of genealogy. An individual who presents an aberration from the color of skin of the group of which he is a member, such as a light-skinned Chinese or Japanese or a dark-skinned Anglo-Saxon, does not thereby acquire a different status under the act from other members of his group. Of course, when an individual applying for citizenship has a skin of a different color than is usual for the members of the group from which he claims to come, a strong burden of proof then rests upon him to show by the usual methods of proving genealogy that he is in fact a member *846 of that group. After the individual has been traced into his group, the second question which the court must answer is whether the members of the group as a whole are white persons as Congress understood the term in 1790 when it first enacted the statute. In deciding this latter question, the test is not how the group in question would be classified by ethnologists who have made a study of racial origins, but, rather, what groups of peoples then living in 1790 with characteristics then existing were intended by Congress to be classified as ‘white persons‘. Applying these principles the court finds that petitioner is an Arab and that Arabs are not white persons within the meaning of the act. \\xa0 It is recognized that in United States v. Cartozian, D.C., 6 F.2d 919, decided subsequent to the Thind case, the District Court held an Armenian from Asia Minor eligible to citizenship as a white person. The court there found, however, that the Armenians are a Christian people living in an area close to the European border, who have intermingled and intermarried with Europeans over a period of centuries. Evidence was also presented in that case of a considerable amount of intermarriage of Armenian immigrants to the United States with other racial strains in population. These facts serve to distinguish the case of the Armenians from that of the Arabians. This court expresses no opinion as to the eligibility of Armenians for citizenship. The petition is denied.The question is whether an Arabian is eligible for naturalization under Sec. 303 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C.A. § 703. The petitioner, Mohamed Mohriez, like his parents and grandparents, was an Arab born in Sanhy, Badan, Arabia. Natives of that part of Asia are admissible to the United States as immigrants and are not barred by the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 874, 876, 8 U.S.C.A. § 136(n). Accordingly Mohriez was on January 15, 1921, admitted to the United States as an immigrant coming here for permanent residence. Mohriez regards himself and his immediate ancestors as being white persons belonging to the white race. He himself spoke Arabian as his native language. The applicable statute, Sec. 303 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C.A. § 703, provides that ‘the right to become a naturalized citizen under the provisions of this chapter shall extend only to white persons, persons of African nativity or descent, and descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere.‘ The local representative of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, acting with the written approval of the Commissioner in Washington, recommends that the petition for citizenship be allowed. He informs me that the present practice of the Immigration and Naturalization Service is to regard Arabs, at any rate if born outside the barred zone, as white persons eligible to citizenship. (See an article entitled *942 ‘The Eligibility of Arabs to Naturalization‘ in the official publication of the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Monthly Review, October 1943, Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 12-16. See also the unreported ruling of the Board of Immigration Appeals on October 18, 1941, in the case of Majid Ramsay Sharif.) But the representative also draws to my attention the fact that rulings adverse to Arabian applicants have been made by the United States District Courts for the Northern District of New York and for the Eastern District of Michigan. In re Ahmed Hassan, D.C.E.D.Mich., 48 F.Supp. 843. If it were not for these rulings of other District Judges I should have granted the petition as of course and without any formal opinion. But in the light of those decisions, I shall briefly give the reasons why I have determined to grant the petition and admit Mohriez to citizenship. [1] In considering whether to grant the petition I as a District Judge must begin with the restrictive construction placed upon R.S. Sec. 2169, 8 U.S.C.A. § 703 note, by the Supreme Court of the United States in Ozawa v. United States, 260 U.S. 178, 43 S.Ct. 65, 67 L.Ed. 199, and United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, 261 U.S. 204, 43 S.Ct. 338, 67 L.Ed. 616. After that construction was adopted, Congress re-enacted that statute as Sec. 303 of the Nationality Act of 1940. The effect of those decisions and that reenactment has been to reject the democratic argument, originally advanced by Mr. George W. Wickersham, that since 1870 Congress intended to allow naturalization of any person regardless of color (260 U.S.at pages 179-185, 43 S.Ct.at page 66, 67 L.Ed. 199), and also to reject the technical argument that Congress intended at least to allow naturalization of any person belonging to a race which ethnologists would call ‘white‘ (261 U.S.at pages 206-215, 43 S.Ct.at pages 339-341, 67 L.Ed. 616). Instead, as indicated by Judge A. N. Hand in Wadia v. United States, 2 Cir., 101 F.2d 7, 9, the question whether one is a ‘free white person‘ within the naturalization law has now become a question to be settled ‘in accordance with the understanding of the common man ‘ and turns on whether the petitioner is a member of one of the ‘races ((a)) inhabiting Europe or ((b)) living along the shores of the Mediterranean‘ or ((c)), perhaps, is a member of a race of ‘Asiatics whose long contiguity to European nations and assimilation with their culture has caused them to be thought of as of the same general characteristics.‘ \\xa0 [2] In the understanding of the common man the Arab people belong to that division of the white race speaking the Semitic languages. (Compare Motteux’ use in 1695 of the term ‘white man‘. Oxford English Dictionary, vol. 12, p. 79.) Both the learned and the unlearned would compare the Arabs with the Jews towards whose naturalization every American Congress since the first has been avowedly sympathetic. (1 Annals of Congress, 1110.) \\xa0 As every schoolboy knows, the Arabs have at various times inhabited parts of Europe, lived along the Mediterranean, been contiguous to European nations and been assimilated culturally and otherwise, by them. From the Battle of Tours to the capitulation of Granada, history records the wars waged in Europe by the Arabs. The names of Avicenna and Averroes, the sciences of algebra and medicine, the population and the architecture of Spain and of Sicily, the very words of the English language, remind us as they would have reminded the Founding Fathers of the action and interaction of Arabic and non-Arabic elements of our culture. (S.P.E. tract No. XXXVIII, ‘Arabic Words in English‘ by Walt Taylor (1933) p. 594.) Indeed, to earlier centuries as to the twentieth century, the Arab people stand as one of the chief channels by which the traditions of white Europe, especially the ancient Greek traditions, have been carried into the present. (Compare Haskins, Renaissance of the Twelfth Century.) It follows that even by the narrow criteria which were adopted in the opinions of Mr. Justice Sutherland the Arab passes muster as a white person. [3] A further consideration supports the view that naturalization is available for Arabs coming from elsewhere than the barred zone. In the debates of Congress (54 Cong.Rec.part 3, pp. 2619, 2622) as well as in the decisions of the courts (United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, 261 U.S. 204, 215, 43 S.Ct. 338, 67 L.Ed. 616) the naturalization and immigration acts have always been regarded as in pari materia. (F. G. Franklin, ‘The Legislative History of Naturalization in the United States, 1776-1795‘, Am. Hist. Ass’n., Annual Report (1901), vol. 1, p. 299.) The general policy has been to say that if a person is *943 admissible to the United States for permanent admission, he is susceptible of naturalization. This policy has obvious advantages. A person ought not to be encouraged to come here to live and to have children born here, who under the Fourteenth Amendment will automatically become citizens, unless we are prepared to give him the advantages of, and expect him to assume the obligations of, United States citizenship. It is contrary to our American creed to create a superior and inferior brand of permanent residents. \\xa0 And finally it may not be out of place to say that, as is shown by our recent changes in the laws respecting persons of Chinese nationality and of the yellow race, we as a country have learned that policies of rigid exclusion are not only false to our professions of democratic liberalism but repugnant to our vital interests as a world power. In so far as the Nationality Act of 1940 is still open to interpretation, it is highly desirable that it should be interpreted so as to promote friendlier relations between the United States and other nations and so as to fulfill the promise that we shall treat all men as created equal. Petition for citizenship granted.'"
